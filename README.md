| :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`Vanilla CSS`**                              | **1.** CSS code is decoupled from JSX code                                                                     | **1.** You need to know CSS                                                                                                                                         |
|                                                | **2.** You write CSS code as you (maybe) know and (maybe) love it                                              | **2.** CSS code is not scoped to components. CSS rules may clash across components (e.g., same CSS class name used in different components for different purposes). |
|                                                | **3.** CSS code can be written by another developer who needs only a minimal amount of access to your JSX code |                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`Inline Styles`**                            | **1.** Quick & easy to add to JSX                                                                              | **1.** You need to know CSS                                                                                                                                         |
| **2.** Dynamic (conditional) styling is simple | **2.** Styles only affect the element to which you add them                                                    | **2.** You need to style every element individually                                                                                                                 |
|                                                |                                                                                                                | **3.** No Separation between CSS & JSX code                                                                                                                         |
